# Scraper
 Web Scraper Using Nodejs


In Terminal: npm run scrape

This will get the Title and URL of Headlines from 'https://www.theguardian.com/us-news' using the H2 class tag.
Ihave tried several other websites with success. Matching the class tags is where it can get tricky.

Once you run the scrape - wait about 10 seconds and hit CNTRL + C and then run the command node index.js > index.log 2>&1 to get a log 
of clickable URL sites with the headlines.


Coming Soon: Having the commands built into the code.
